# Swashbuckler
A computerized version of the 1980 Yaquinto board game.

This is a work in progress and I have not had much time to work on it lately. Most of the relevant notes are in `TODO`s buried in the code until I clean it up a bit. The project is currently in a transition state from `swashbuckler` to `swashbuckler3`.
